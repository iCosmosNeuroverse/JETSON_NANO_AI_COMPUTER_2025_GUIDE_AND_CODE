# JETSON_NANO_AI_COMPUTER_2025_GUIDE

Side note: This nano unit I cherish. I have had this Jetson nano unit for about 7 years now. It's the same unit that ended up getting me featured by Nvidia for pothole detection project that I had posted. NVIDIA still remains world's most powerful AI driver a company worth over 3 trillion. Go to [Nvidia Jetson feature page](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/jetson-projects) and search for "pothole" then select smart pothole detector project that pops up in the results, or check out the [short link](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/jetson-projects/ai_pothole_detector).
